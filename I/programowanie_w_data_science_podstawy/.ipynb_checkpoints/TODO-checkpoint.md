Matrix project:
- Refactor
- Implement 'flatten' method
- Use list elements in iterators rather than ranges where possible
- Make sure that the given matrix has a dimension of maximum 3 by 3 (or implement logic for higher dimensions)
- Encapsulate logic in smaller, more precise methods
- Test inplace feature
